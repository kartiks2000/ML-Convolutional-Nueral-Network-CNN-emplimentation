ML Convolutional Nueral Network (CNN) emplimentation

# We have to manually preprocess the dataset by seperating different types of images and splitting it into test and train set.


# Down load datset from  https://www.superdatascience.com/pages/deep-learning  and then got to the CNN section.


# The datset is has to be divided into two parts training and testing dataset, and further divided into labels/categories like in thos case it is CAT and DOG.
